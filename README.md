The code in this profile makes use of the following external assets:

- ["Beep" sound by Efecto Fundador (Freesound.org)](https://www.freesound.org/people/Efecto%20Fundador/sounds/195929/) - Used as audio feedback for button presses
- [Elite:Dangerous favicon.ico](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) - I used the favicon from the Elite:Dangerous website as both a favicon and a homepage icon on this project.
- [Foundation: CSS Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/) - Allows for rapid UI development on small projects
- [howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/) - Used for playing audio using modern browser functionality
- [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - Used to achieve better cross-browser consistency
